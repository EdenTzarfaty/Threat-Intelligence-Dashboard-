# Notes

### AI Integration - with researchers
- Would integrate AI tools for data investigation and recommendations
- AI-powered threat analysis and intelligent insights
- Automated pattern recognition in threat data

### Project Structure & Architecture
- Separated dependencies into organized folders: components, utils, services, etc.
- Used Promise.all for parallel API calls to improve performance

### Logging & Monitoring
- In a real project, I would add comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- More detailed error handling and tracking

### Backend Enhancements
- Would add providers/DI (Dependency Injection) in the backend
- For larger projects, would use TypeScript to ensure type safety

### Real-time Updates
- Instead of localStorage, would implement WebSocket or polling for real-time data updates. This would allow live updates when IP threat data changes

### strings file
- Would create a strings file for all text content to support multiple languages

### Security & Validation
- Would implement input sanitization to prevent malicious scripts

### Accessibility
- Would focus on accessibility features for better user experience

### Code Organization
- Current implementations are minimal and focused
- In larger projects, components would be more complex and feature-rich
- Modular approach allows for easy scaling
